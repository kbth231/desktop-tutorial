# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Write your name on line 6, save it, and then head back to GitHub Desktop.

The goal of this lab is to become comfortable with using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop. Using Git is beneficial when collaborating with others to ensure that you have control over the code you write. This also allows for others to alter copies of your work without changing your version. In conclusion, I am excited to be able to utilize these applications to make collaboration easier.
